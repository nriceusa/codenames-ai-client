# Notes

## Brainstorm
- Attempt to have a model "reason," going "step by step"
- Measure the mean-squared distance of each word-vector to the others, choose two words that are the closest to each other, and present a clue word that is the closest to the middle.
- Present clues to a model until it's able to successfuly guess the right word. Then present that clue to the user.
